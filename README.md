# XD.js source
OTC v3 javascript
This is the source of my customized version of a javascript made for the cracked version of onetap.com (OTC v3). The script was improved using otc3 cord , one of the best open-source js for HvH for OTC3 as the base version.

The original script was made by Sleebu#0448.

Original script link : https://brokencore.club/threads/9891/

This version has  more than 100 features that focuses on improving the misc/ rage / visuals aspect of the original OTC3

"XD.js" was a name one of my friends named it when the script was still in improvement process.
